This code borrows heavily from the [[https://www.wxforum.net/index.php?topic=30471.50][perl script written by wx5020 on www.wxforum.net]] and the [[https://github.com/AussieSusan/HP1000][HP1000 driver by Susan Mackay]]


* WS5000
Regrettably, one cannot read directly from the WS5000, according to the documentation.
The full API is available only on GW1000, WH2650 and wn1900 stations.
So, we can't go any further with this approach, and must instead "listen" to TCP messages sent from the console.
